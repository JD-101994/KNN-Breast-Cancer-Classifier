# Breast Cancer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository implements a KNN model to classify breast cancer data using the scikit-learn library in Python.

**Project Overview**

Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer affecting women globally. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to develop a KNN-based classification model that can help distinguish between malignant and benign breast tumors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dependencies**

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Data

The project utilizes the built-in load_breast_cancer function from scikit-learn to load the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. This dataset consists of features extracted from breast tissue samples and their corresponding classifications (malignant or benign).

Model Training and Evaluation

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The load_breast_cancer function is used to load the dataset.
The data is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance.
KNN Model Creation:

A KNN classifier is instantiated with an appropriate n_neighbors value (number of neighbors to consider for classification).
Model Training:

The KNN model is trained on the training data, learning the relationships between features and class labels.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model's accuracy is assessed on the validation data.
The code iterates through a range of n_neighbors values to determine the optimal value that yields the highest accuracy.
Visualization:

A plot is generated to visualize the relationship between the n_neighbors parameter and the model's accuracy. This helps identify the optimal n_neighbors value for the KNN model.
Running the Script

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install the required libraries using pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib.
Run the Python script (main.py or adjust the filename if different) to execute the KNN model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Further Exploration

Experiment with different hyperparameter values (e.g., distance metric, number of neighbors) to potentially improve model performance.
Consider incorporating feature engineering techniques to extract more informative features from the data.
Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) for comparison and potentially better classification accuracy.
Additional Notes

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs and experimentation goals.
Consider adding comments and docstrings to enhance code readability and maintainability.
